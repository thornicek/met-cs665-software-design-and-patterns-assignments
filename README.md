# Met CS 665 Software Design and Patterns Assignments

This repository contains all my assignments I had to do for my Software Design and Patterns class. In this class we have covered software design principles, the object-oriented paradigm, unified modeling language; creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns. Each assignment implements one or more design patterns, which we covered in class.
